# Wireframing
##  Introduction to Wireframing
- Wireframing is the process of creating a low-fidelity, visual representation of a website or app's layout, functionality, and user flow. It focuses on the structure and content hierarchy rather than visual design elements like colors or fonts.
### Importance of Wireframing 
**Importance of Wireframing**: Wireframes help you identify potential usability problems early in the design process, leading to a more user-friendly final product.

**Increases Communication**: Facilitates communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders by providing a clear visual reference for the project's direction.

**Saves Time and Money**: Identifying and fixing issues early with wireframes is more efficient than making changes later in the development process.
